# 🐍 Usefull Python Scripts

A growing collection of small but powerful Python scripts I’ve made for everyday tasks,
automation, and quick utilities. Each script is designed to be simple, efficient,
and easy to reuse in your own projects.

## ⚡ Purpose
A personal toolkit of handy Python snippets and mini-tools that solve small but
annoying problems quickly.

## 📂 Scripts Collection

• img_extraction.py — Scans a directory and all its subfolders, then moves every image
  (including .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, .webp, .tiff, .ico, .svg)
  into a new 'images' folder. Perfect for organizing messy project folders.

## 💡 How to use (change img_extraction.py to desired script) 
Clone the repo and run any script directly:<br>

```git clone https://github.com/LabheshGupta/Usefull-python-Scripts.git``` <br>
```cd Usefull-python-Scripts```<br>
```python ScriptsCollection/img_extraction.py```

OR 

download the script and open the folder in terminal and run the following code:
```python
python <name>.py
```

(can someone help me make a decent readme 😭)
